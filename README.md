## Overview

The Winter Supplement Rules Engine is designed to work with the Winter Supplement Calculator web application using an event-driven architecture. It receives input data from the web app, processes the data based on predefined rules, and publishes the calculated results back to the web app.

The rules engine is responsible for:
1. Determining a client's eligibility for the Winter Supplement.
2. Calculating the eligible supplement amount based on the client's assistance program and family composition.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `paho-mqtt` library

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/winter-supplement-rules-engine.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd winter-supplement-rules-engine
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Updating MQTT Topic ID
To run the rules engine on your local machine, you'll need to update the MQTT topic ID. Follow these steps:

1. Access the Winter Supplement Calculator web application using the provided credentials:
   - Username: `user`
   - Password: `r44UKbfSeIn9AZjI4Ed24xr6`
2. Note the MQTT topic ID displayed on the web page.
3. Open the `main.py` file and update the `TOPIC_INPUT` and `TOPIC_OUTPUT` variables with the new topic ID.

## Usage

1. Start the rules engine:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Use the Winter Supplement Calculator web app to generate input data and test the rules engine.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure the rules engine is working as expected. To run the tests:

1. Install the test dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the tests:
   ```
   pytest tests/
